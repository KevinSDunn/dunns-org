# About Us

Hello and welcome to our site. Think of it as a virtual campfire. Pull up a chair and pour your favorite drink. We love to tell stories, swap tips, and share our travels.

Here are some things to know about us. We are not full-timers. We enjoy trips of a couple of weeks currently - more driven by my job limitations than anything else. Long term? Sure we want to take longer trips in Reset.

# About Reset and Blue Moose

Reset is an Oliver Legacy Elite I. She is a single axle fiberglass beauty who tows like a dream, is warm and cozy in the winter and delightfully cool (if a bit loud) in the summer.

The Oliver trailer line is built in Hohenwald, TN and only available new through the factory. If you want to learn more about an Oliver or even see one you can get a tour from a real Oliver owner almost anywhere in the country. Tell them that the Dunns and Reset Hull #1030 sent you. :-)

Yes - every Oliver has a number. It's sequential - regardless of if it's a I or a II. Each Oliver gets a plate inside the door that gives the Hull number - just like a ship. Our Reset was built in 2022 and hit the road in February of that year. You can follow our travels in the Triplog section of this site.

Now on to Blue Moose, our 2022 Ascent Limited tow vehicle. Blue Moose is our 8th Subaru vehicle, and was purchased specifially for towing Reset. We did not go with the premium as Subaru does not offer the bench rear seat in anything but the Limited line, and we needed the cargo capacity more than iPad holders in the rear seat (LOL).

Blue Moose has the factory towing options installed, including the automatic anti-sway feature. This means no weight distributuon or anti-sway hitch can be used between the Moose and Reset. We use a Weigh Safe trailer ball to verify tongue weight on every tow, and have upgraded the Moose to have a Redarc Tow Pro II brake controller hidden inside the dashboard.

The combination of Blue Moose and Reset travels like a dream, crusing between 65 and 70 mph on the highway at 14 to 16 MPG. We are still working on the best combination of tire pressure for the best ride vs gas milage.
