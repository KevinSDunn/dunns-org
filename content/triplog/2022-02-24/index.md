_Start of a new adventure!_

After months of waiting, we finally have Reset Hull #1030. All the considering, planning, and list making has finally paid off.

How did we get here? Our camping adventure as a family started with tent camping to Colorado. It was a deliberate adventure. We did several "practice" camping trips then headed out to Palo Duro and up to the southern parts of Colorado.

After the kids graduated from high school and went to college, we started talking about getting a trailer. Main reason was to have somewhere to not sleep on the ground. We found a used Happier Camper (#48) and our three years of adventures with Shadow started.

Shadow was a lifesaver during the pandemic. We could go camp when no other options to travel were open. We did a trip across the western states to California to take Shadow in for maintenance, as well as trips to San Antonio and several Texas State Parks. We also discovered Hot Springs AK as a camping destination.

As we did more traveling, we decided we wanted something a bit bigger, more structured, and with a bathroom. We had looked at Oliver trailers in the past but had always felt that they were too much for us. However, after a lot of research into trailers including the Escape, the Barefoot, and Airstream, we fell in love with the design, quality, and the owner community that is the Oliver family.
